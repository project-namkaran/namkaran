# Shajhanion

**Shajhanion** = 10^(10⁷²)  
That’s a **1 followed by one tresvigintillion zeros**.

---

## 🧠 Concept

Shajhanion holds space in the numberverse for yet another tier of scale. It’s beautifully useless and intentionally unfathomable — but now, finally, named.

---

## 📊 Comparison

- Writing the zeros would take multiple Earth lifetimes — of all lifeforms combined.
- Its name makes the unnameable speakable.
