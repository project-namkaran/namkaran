# Octoparvezilion

**Octoparvezilion** = 10^(10⁸⁴)  
That’s a **1 followed by one septenvigintillion zeros**.

---

## 🧠 Concept

Octoparvezilion moves beyond the framework of known physics. It’s a celebration of scale — exaggerated, extravagant, and entirely theoretical.

---

## 📊 Comparison

- Septenvigintillion = 10^84.
- If every atom wrote a zero, we’d still fall short.
