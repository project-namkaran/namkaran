# Septenawazilion

**Septenawazilion** = 10^(10⁶)  
That’s a **1 followed by one million zeros**.

---

## 🧠 Concept

This number represents the leap from thousand-scale magnitude to **million-level scale** in the Project Namkaran series. A Septenawazilion is unimaginably large — vastly beyond anything in conventional use or science.

## 📊 Comparison

- A Googol is 10^100 — already massive.
- Septenawazilion is **10^(10^6)**, or 1 with a million zeros — on an entirely different tier.
